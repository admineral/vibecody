# 3D Code Cards - Immersive Galaxy Space Environment
## Implementation Plan & Requirements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**
Create an immersive 3D code visualization experience where users float through a realistic galaxy space environment while interacting with iPhone-style code cards arranged in a circle. The environment should feel like traveling through deep space with the Andromeda galaxy visible in the distance.

## ðŸŒŒ **Detailed Requirements**

### **3D Space Environment**
**Starfield System:**
- Generate 5000+ stars in spherical distribution around scene (radius: 200-1000 units)
- Use violet-tinted color palette with varying brightness (0.3-1.0)
- Implement size variation (1-4 units) with proper depth attenuation
- Add gentle rotation animation (0.005 rad/s Y-axis, 0.002 rad/s X-axis)
- Use additive blending for realistic star glow effect

**Andromeda Galaxy:**
- Position at coordinates [-80, 20, -150] for optimal viewing
- Create central core (8-unit sphere) with pink/violet emission (#ff6b9d)
- Build 3 spiral arms using torus geometries (radii: 12, 16, 20 units)
- Apply gradient colors: #9d4edd â†’ #c77dff â†’ #e0aaff
- Add outer glow sphere (25 units) with dark violet (#240046)
- Animate with slow rotation (0.02 rad/s) and floating motion

**Nebula Clouds:**
- Place 4 nebula clouds at strategic positions with varying sizes (10-18 units)
- Use violet color palette: #8b5cf6, #a855f7, #c084fc, #ddd6fe
- Set transparency (0.15 opacity) with subtle emissive glow
- Position for depth perception: [50,30,-80], [-60,-20,-100], [30,-40,-120], [-40,50,-90]

### **Code Card Specifications**
**Visual Design:**
- iPhone-style rounded corners using RoundedBox geometry
- Glass-like material with subtle transparency and reflection
- Card dimensions: 4Ã—6 units with 0.1 unit thickness
- Subtle bevel effect around edges for premium feel
- Color-coded borders based on file type

**Content Display:**
- Syntax-highlighted code snippets (max 15 lines visible)
- File type icons in top-left corner
- Filename and metadata in header
- Line numbers on the left side
- Proper font rendering with monospace typography

**Positioning & Animation:**
- Arrange in perfect circle formation (8-unit radius)
- Face cards outward from center for optimal readability
- Smooth hover animations (scale: 1.0 â†’ 1.05, glow effect)
- Selection state with enhanced glow and slight forward movement
- Smooth transitions using easing functions

### **Interaction System**
**View Modes:**
- **Orbit Mode**: Automatic camera orbit with user-controllable speed (0-3x)
- **Free Mode**: Full mouse control with OrbitControls (pan, zoom, rotate)
- Seamless switching between modes with Space key
- Smart pause system: auto-rotation stops during user interaction

**Keyboard Controls:**
- Arrow Left/Right: Rotate card circle manually
- Arrow Up/Down: Adjust orbit speed in orbit mode
- Space: Toggle between orbit and free view modes
- Numbers 1-9: Select specific cards directly
- Escape: Reset view and clear selections

**Mouse Interaction:**
- Hover detection with visual feedback
- Click to select cards
- Drag to rotate camera in free mode
- Zoom with mouse wheel
- Activity detection with 2-second timeout

### **Control Panel Features**
**Parameter Controls:**
- Card count slider: 0-100 cards with real-time updates
- Orbit speed control: 0-3x multiplier with fine adjustment
- View mode toggle buttons with visual state indicators

**Memory Management:**
- Efficient geometry reuse
- Proper cleanup of unused resources
- Optimized texture loading and caching
- Smart update cycles to avoid unnecessary re-renders
